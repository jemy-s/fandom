He issues a mental command to a nearby girl to come to the castle and extinguish the candles. The girl is actually Victoria Bentley, daughter of Lord Bentley who has been dead for ten years. Mordo returns, attacking Strange with his mental powers and orders Strange to kill Victoria, who possesses a latent mystical talent. Just then Strange arrives in his mortal form. it was only his projected image that had been in the castle until then.

              "text": "Sue refers to Captain America as an \"old comics magazine hero.\" Sue's opinion that Captain America is nothing more than a myth seems out of place, considering the number of stories that have (since) been published that establish that Captain America was indeed a real person. The point fairly punctuated in Marvels #1 that shows Captain America's exploits were well documented, including his disappearance in 1945. as well as Captain America: Man Out of Time #3, which shows an entire exhibit on Captain America and the three individuals who succeeded him at the Smithsonian. Still, to the point, she could be referring to the fact that, per Young Allies Comics 70th Anniversary Special #1, the United States military commissioned Timely Comics to create propaganda in the form of comic books to boost America's support of super heroes. As such Captain America Comics Vol 1 would have been published in the Earth-616 universe.",
